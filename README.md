Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?    
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.    
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves    
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back    
When the wind blows the water white and black.    
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea    
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown    
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

**- "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"**
